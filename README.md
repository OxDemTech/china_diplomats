# Replication Material and R/Python/SQL Code for Dem.Tech Working Papers 2021.1 and 2021.2: China's Diplomats on Twitter

Hello and thank you for your interest in our research. 

Following an open and transparent research philosophy, we are committed to making our findings as accessible and reproducible as possible. To do so, we are currently structuring and commenting the full R, Python and SQL code used to conduct the analyses presented in our two PRC diplomat working papers. Furthermore, we are working with our research support team to assess the maximum degree of raw data we are allowed to share publicly under the respective legal and ethical boundaries. 

Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions about the methodology or implementation. You can reach us at demtech(at)oii.ox.ac.uk. 

Thank you very much and best regards,
the author team (@OxDemTech)

## R, Python and SQL code used to conduct the analyses

The code used to collect the raw Twitter and Facebook data has already been added to the repository and is currently being polished and commented. Over the course of the next few days, we will continuously add and comment the full set of all code files used for this analysis, and include more information on the structure and analysis pipeline here. 

## Replication data 
We are currently conducting a review of the legal and ethical guidelines to determine what Twitter and Facebook data we are allowed to share in this public repository. One these reviews are concluded, we are committed to sharing data as liberally and openly as possible.
